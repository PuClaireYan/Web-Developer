		<h2>Old English Sheepdog</h2>

		<p class="quote">The Old English Sheepdog (OES) is a large breed of dog which was developed in England from early herding types of dog. The Old English Sheepdog can grow a very long coat, with fur covering the face and eyes. Obsolete names of the breed include Shepherd's Dog and bob-tailed sheep-dog. It is still nicknamed Bob-tail (or Bobtail) because historically, the tail was traditionally docked in this breed.</p>

		<p>The Old English Sheepdog is immediately recognizable by its long, thick, shaggy grey and white coat, with fur covering their face and eyes. The ears lie flat to the head. Historically, the breed's tail was commonly docked (resulting in a panda bear-like rear end), but tailed Old English sheepdogs are now common, as many countries have outlawed cosmetic docking. When the dog has a tail, it has long fur (feathering), is low set, and normally hangs down.[3] The Old English Sheepdog stands lower at the shoulder than at the loin,[4] and walks with a "bear-like roll from the rear".[5]</p>

		<p>Height at the withers is at least 61 cm (24 in), with females slightly smaller than males.[5] The body is short and compact, and ideal weights are not specified in the breed standards, but may be as much as 46 kg (101 lb) for large males.</p>

		<h2>Goldendoodle</h2>

		<p class="quote">The Goldendoodle is a cross-breed dog, which is obtained by breeding a Golden Retriever with a Poodle. The name, which alters "poodle" to "doodle" by analogy to "Labradoodle", was coined in 1992.</p>

		<p>The Goldendoodle was first bred by Monica Dickens in 1969.[1] Popularity for the goldendoodle grew in the 1990s[2] when breeders in North America and Australia began crossing Golden Retrievers with Standard Poodles.[3] The original purpose of the cross was to develop guide dogs suitable for visually impaired individuals with allergies. Poodles are considered to be hypoallergenic. Their coats do not shed, which reduces dander.[4] Dander is a protein that sheds from the skin and causes allergies in humans.</p>

		<p>The goldendoodle is referred to as a designer dog. The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica traces the term "designer dog" to the late 20th century when breeders began to cross purebred Poodles with other purebred breeds in order to obtain a dog with the poodle's non-shedding coat, along with various desirable characteristics from other breeds.[5] In regards to goldendoodles, golden retrievers are considered a great family dog,[6] which is why they have been used to cross breed with poodles.</p>
